In this project, I identified indicators of heavy traffic volume on US I-94, an east-west interstate highway connecting the Great Lakes and northern Great Plains. Data for the project came from the [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume).
